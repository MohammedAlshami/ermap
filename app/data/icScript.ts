    content: 'Manufacturing → DC Conversion',
    fullText: 'All carbonated drinks originate from a single plant in Sandakan, then flow into a decentralised DC network across the state. Water production is localised closer to demand, reducing freight cost and improving service reliability. This is a deliberate hub-and-spoke system optimised for Sabah\'s terrain.',

    content: 'Cost Moat & Operating Leverage',
    fullText: 'What matters is not just coverage, but density. With 90 trucks and five distribution centres already embedded, incremental volume — whether water, flavoured drinks, or Twinine sauces — rides on the same routes at marginal cost. A new entrant would need to spend over RM200m and several years just to stand still.',

    content: 'Why This Is a Catalyst',
    fullText: 'As capacity expands and new FMCG SKUs are layered in, fixed logistics costs are amortised over higher revenue. This is operating leverage driven by sunk infrastructure — and it\'s why Life Water should structurally out-earn smaller or Peninsular Malaysia competitors in Sabah.',
