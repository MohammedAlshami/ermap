# Documentation First Rule

## Before Making Any Changes

**ALWAYS** read the documentation in the `documentation/` folder first.

## Documentation Structure

```
documentation/
├── index.md                    # Start here - Overview of all docs
├── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md        # Project organization and structure
├── components/
│   └── MapLibrary.md          # Complete API reference for MapLibrary
└── instructions/
    └── how-to-use.md          # Detailed guide on modifying slides
```

## Reading Order

### 1. First Time Working on This Project:
1. Read `documentation/index.md` - Quick overview
2. Read `documentation/instructions/how-to-use.md` - How to modify slides
3. Read `documentation/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Understand the structure

### 2. When Modifying the Map:
1. Read `documentation/instructions/how-to-use.md`
2. Open `app/config/slidesConfig.tsx`
3. Make your changes (this is the ONLY file to modify)

### 3. When Adding Features to the Library:
1. Read `documentation/components/MapLibrary.md`
2. Read `documentation/instructions/how-to-use.md`
3. Understand the API before modifying

### 4. When Adding a New Country:
1. Read `documentation/instructions/how-to-use.md`
2. Look at `app/templates/country-template.tsx`
3. Follow the multi-country setup guide

## Why Read Documentation First?

- ✅ Understand the project architecture
- ✅ Know which files to modify
- ✅ Avoid creating README files
- ✅ Follow established patterns
- ✅ Use proper data paths
- ✅ Maintain consistency

## Quick Reference

| Task | Documentation File |
|------|-------------------|
| Modify map/slides | `documentation/instructions/how-to-use.md` |
| Add new feature | `documentation/components/MapLibrary.md` |
| Understand structure | `documentation/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` |
| Quick overview | `documentation/index.md` |

## Remember:

**The documentation folder is the single source of truth.**

- All answers are in `documentation/`
- Don't guess - read the docs
- Don't create new README files - update docs in `documentation/`
- If something is unclear, ask the user rather than making assumptions
